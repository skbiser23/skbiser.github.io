Selfiecity is a multimedia platform in which users can interact with numerous data features of thousands of selfies from across the world.  Pioneered by a team of creative data analysis experts from around the world, Selfiecity collected 1000 selfies each from New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, Bangkok, and Moscow.  The project then presented both qualitative and quantitative statistics and connections between these modern self portraits.  From creating an interactive Selfiexploratory that allows users to filter through thousands of the collected selfies, to exhibiting theoretical research discussing the implications of findings and the role of selfies in historical photography - Selfiecity offers a uniquely analytical perspective into a seemingly unimportant phenomenon.

One of the best features of Selfiecity is the concise nature in which it presents such a large amount of data.  The site is extremely accessible, and is set up as just one continuous page that can easily be navigated from the tabs at the top (aside from the Selfiexploratory).  In a way, Selfiecity feels like a bus tour through the timeline of the project, offering stops at major landmarks, and allowing users to stay and conduct their own research for as long as they like.

One of the best features of Selfiecity is the accessibility it has to all ages and academic experiences.  Some Digital Humanities projects are bogged down with an overload of information, or have a very specific theme that makes it difficult to see their role in society.  Selfiecity, however, is clear in its purpose and allows users to view certain portions of the site without having to view others.  Because the site is mainly a tool to filter through thousands of photos and datasets, it seems that it could be used for both a professional presentation on societal trends and a middle school class project.

One of the most elaborate data presentations in Selfiecity is undoubtedly the Selfiexploratory.  This feature encourages users to toy around with every aspect of the selfie imaginable.  For example, one can narrow down photos by city, age, gender, the view of the face (glasses, mouth position, eye direction, head tilt, etc.), and mood on a scale of angry, calm, and happy.  Additionally, each of these filters can be overlapped.  If a user wanted to view each selfie with someone who looked to be thirty years old, tilted their head to the right, opened their eyes, and had glasses, they could do it!

Besides the novelty and fun of this dataset, the Selfiexploratory is great for users to individually discover patterns, rather than simply reading them in an essay or report.  The Selfiexploratory works in the true collaborative spirit of digital humanities, allowing the audience to create the results of their own studies.

You may be asking - what’s the point?  What does all of these selfie data actually do for us?  At first glance, I pondered the same questions.  That is, until I hopped onto the project’s Theory page.  Here, the team has included further research conducted with the data and statistics offered by Selfiecity.  The essays are quite intriguing, with most of them peering into modern societal and cultural movements.

For example, Selfiecity states in their Findings page that women consistently take about two times more selfies than men.  Elizabeth Losh of University of California then comprised an essay analyzing this phenomenon from a feminist point of view - “Beyond Biometrics: Feminist Media Theory Looks at Selfiecity.”  In this light, Selfiecity carries no agenda, and serves only as an easily accessible dataset, encouraging open interpretation.

A difficulty that one may find using Selfiecity is its binary gender approach.  This is not a totally valid critique though, as the project was established in 2014 when gender was still largely viewed as binary.  This comment does lead one to acknowledge the oddity of viewing a social media project from 2014 in 2020.  Selfiecity unintentionally offers modern users a nostalgic look into the past, and maybe into the beginning of their own interest in social media.

From self-portraits to cultural movements, Selfiecity presents a perfect platform for users to create their own experience.  Though the content may be a bit outdated, the project is a perfect introduction to Digital Humanities, as well as a great source of media data for the mid-2010s.  Selfiecity took advantage of all aspects of its data, and compiled it into an accessible, diverse, and innovative tool for all social media users alike.
