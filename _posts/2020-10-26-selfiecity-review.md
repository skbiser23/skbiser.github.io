title: Selfiecity Review
---

Selfiecity is a multimedia platform in which users can interact with numerous data features of thousands of selfies from across the world.  Pioneered by a team of creative data analysis experts from around the world, Selfiecity collected 1000 selfies each from New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, Bangkok, and Moscow.  The project then presented both qualitative and quantitative statistics and connections between these modern self portraits.  From creating an interactive Selfiexploratory that allows users to filter through thousands of the collected selfies, to exhibiting theoretical research discussing the implications of findings and the role of selfies in historical photography - Selfiecity offers a uniquely analytical perspective into a seemingly unimportant phenomenon.
