The overall purpose of the TEI coding project was for everyone in our class to collectively create a digital edition of the periodical version of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper.”  Each student was assigned roughly a column of text (I had column 2 on page 654), and was expected to code it according to TEI (Text Encoding Initiative).  Eventually, the individual portions of text will be compiled into a complete digital edition.

The learning process for basic coding was comprehensive but surprisingly short.  I had no previous experience with TEI - or any type of coding for that matter - so when I heard about this assignment, I was startled to say the least.  However, Dr. Stover led us in a two-step process that simplified any complexities of TEI coding.

The first step involved receiving a Google Document with our assigned text.  We were to proof-read it to ensure that there were no mistakes in transfer, or typos in the original text.  We were then introduced to the various tags involved in TEI coding, which include: page beginnings, columns, paragraphs, em-dashes, italics, errors, quotes, illustrations, titles, and bylines.  It was around this time that relief started to set in.  I realized that the coding process would be quite easy, especially because the majority of my tags were paragraphs, italics, and em-dashes.

I found it easiest to color-code the tags on the text in my Google Doc, instead of the comment method that others used.  When I was transferring my text into the XML  (eXtensible Markup Language) window, I could tag all of the paragraphs at once, then all of the italics, etc. simply by completing the colors in groups.

After making my Google Doc look similar to some sort of a rainbow explosion, I then copied and pasted my text into the XML window.  No matter how many times I rewrote the tags and pasted the text, I could not get my code to clear.  This is where I encountered my first coding mistake - I was using the TEI program instead of TEI Lite.  A very simple fix, but crucial nonetheless.

After recognizing my error, I cut my text along with all of its tags, and pasted it straight into TEI Lite.  A green box was waiting for me, meaning that my code was error-free, and I was thrilled!  I am not familiar with the difference between TEI and TEI Lite, but I assume that TEI requires much more detailed initial document setup than its Lite version, since I was able to paste my text straight into the program with no edits.

This TEI assignment, as well as our blog writing assignments have opened my eyes to the world of coding in many ways.  One of which is the simplicity of the various programs we’ve used.  Before having any coding experience, I was under then impression that plain text was unheard of in code.  In reality, most of the programs we use simply take plain text and put tags in front of and behind it.  While I’m sure codes get much more complex than what I’ve worked with, the process is still much more straightforward than I imagined.  I’m glad that coding is so accessible and easy to start!
