# Editing the plan, once more
At the end of my last blog, I had decided to focus in on my coffee timeline that featured the origination of coffee in different world regions, as well as coffee recipes from different cultures across the globe.  Once I dug further into my grant-writing process, I decided to reframe once again.  This was triggered by my questioning the actual importance of coffee origins and recipes, and wanting to do something that I felt was more consequential in our world today.

I began to look into the implications that coffee as a trade has on the countries that produce it, as well as the sustainability of coffee production, and the ideas began to flow immediately.

# Interactive Mapping
I decided to go with an interactive mapping project that would highlight statistics of coffee consumption, production, and number of Starbucks stores in each country.

My idea behind these specific statistics was to hopefully enlighen my audience to the harsh difference between production and consumption - the US and EU are leading in consumption by a complete landslide, and none of the countries affiliated produce an ounce of coffee.  This is partly due to geographic location, but also sheds light on the consumption privilege that we hold as first-world citizens, hence the inclusion of the number of Starbucks stores per country.

# Environmental scan - success!
In my last blog post, I wrote a lot about how frustrated I was with writing my environmental scan.  When I first started to look for projects similar to mine in topic, I couldn't find anything related to coffee, or even food and drink in general.

However, once I fleshed out my idea, put an agenda behind it, and decided on the medium I would use, I found lots of applicable sources.  I stopped searching for "coffee digital humanities projects" and instead changed my search to "coffee sustainability" or "interactive mapping projects."

# Data Visualization
By far, the most interesting topic I learned about throughout my grant-writing process was data visualization.  I have always loved learning about learning styles (unfortunately there's no graceful way to say that), so when I read that data visualization has been proven to improve understanding and engagement with numerical information, I was hooked!  I was able to find a whole additional argument for why my project is unique and important, all while becoming enlightened on persuasive methods of graphic data visualization.

In the process of my data visualization research, I found a super helpful article on the Tableau website that listed ten exemplary interactive maps with data visualization.  The project below stood out to me because at each dot on the map, it features where the language originated, where it is spoken, and how much of the world population speaks it.  This one definitely helped me out by showing me what a statistical map can look like.

# A bit of Resume trouble
One of the biggest hurdles during this project was making my resume seem applicable to my project.  My resume was one of the last things I edited before submitting the project, and I ended up wishing that I had chosen a project more similar to my major, as all of my skills, experiences, and accomplishments are solely music related.  However, I am planning on entering the field of nutrition in the next few years, so having this realization now was especially helpful in preparing my career path.

# Summing it up
Overall, I'm super happy with how my project turned out.  I feel that my grant narrative effectively "sold" my project, and my environmental scan covered every aspect of my project.  This project really got my writing gears turning, so I'm definitely thankful that finally landed on a topic that I'm passionate about.  Who knows, maybe you'll be seeing an interactive coffee map on the web in the next few years!
